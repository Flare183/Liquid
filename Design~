So basic design stuff here...

Language:
Python
Library:
PyQt4

We should strive to keep everything simple. Using as few libs and keep "clutter" down
Functionality beats looks. Since we are not going to write our own WM(yet) the taskbar
Should be just a taskbar, with tasks, a menu(like gnomes(zc00gii's suggestion) With applications
and places.

The good thing about python is that it is interpreted. Meaning that a user can change what ever
he wants without compiling everything again.

GOALS:
Small.
Lightweight in the sense that you do not need kdelibs or gnome libraries to do everyday tasks
like browsing the internet or programming.
Since our language of choice is python, it should not be intended to use on ancient hardware
but any computer made in the last 3-5 years should be able to run it at full speed.
Extended functionality, providing user interaction whenever it is needed.

Personal wishes:
Tabbed, why can't everything be tabbed? Multiple instances of the same program is annoying.
This is just my(Nibble) wish for now. We could argue about it on irc for a while if you have any objections.

Some basic stuff we will need:
Browser(should provide functions like bookmarks and flash, again Qt makes this a brease.)
Taskbar(includes app menu, systray and window list. 
Should be kept very clean and integrate good with different backgrounds.)
Editor(Nothing fancy, just an editor, no IDE functionality needed.)
IRC client(this is an everyday application, not highest priority though.)
File Manager(Again should be kept clean and simple)
